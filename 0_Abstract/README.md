# Abstract

Over the past few decades, the automotive industry has relentlessly been into 
research involving different ways to harness the power of computing and to make
a hopeful shift from mechanization to automation to aid the advancements in the
development of safety, reliability and entertainment technologies for vehicles.
Every road mishap which is happening in the world round the clock has the unionizing reason of
distraction. So it is always in the best interest of everyone to reduce these 
distractions.

When there is rain or snow while driving vehicles, the effective visibility is compromised
at the driver's end which poses a great threat to life. In this situation, the wiper system 
comes to the rescue. But the traditional wiper system requires constant driver
attention in adjusting the wiper speed based on the severity of rain or snow. Because this manual
adjustment of the wiper speed distracts the driver's attention, it can lead to accidents thus
making the existence of this whole system futile. 

So to counter this situation, the project titled 'Wiper Control System' is developed.
The objective of this project is to initiate the automatic wiper action by sensing 
the intensity of the rain or snow and thus increasing or decreasing the wiper 
speed accordingly. This automatic wiper system has a sensing unit, a controller
which has 'STM32F407VG' Microcontroller at its core and a motor unit which
moves the arm of the wiper thus facilitating the wiping action.

In this project, the proof of concept stage is explored and hence initial
press of a button is assumed to be the start of ignition. The subsequent three presses
of the button are assumed to be the different levels of speed control offered by 
the designed controller ranging from low, medium and high. The final press of
the button is assumed to be the stop of ignition. The movement of the wiper arm 
from left to right and back again is illustrated by the blinking of the blue,
green and orange LEDs in the desired pattern.
